# Computational Geometry

This is a project meant to help persons visualize computational geometry algorithms. It uses JSXGraph to display the graphical portions of these algorithms. It contains wraparound objects and functions so that future developers can easily implement additional algorithms and add them to this collection. Please contact RRDerber@gmail.com if you're interested in making additions.

See the impleentation of quickhull for a commented example of an algorithm implementation.
